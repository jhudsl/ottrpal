The original template: https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template is always a work in progress.
We are working on adding more features and smoothing out bugs as we go.

If you want to receive updates from the original template to your course template, you will need to enroll this repository to the template updates by adding it to the `sync.yml` file.

- [ ] [Follow these instructions](https://www.ottrproject.org/getting_started.html#9_Enroll_your_repository_for_OTTR_updates) to enroll your course repository to receive these updates.
  - [ ] Alternatively, [open an issue in the OTTR_Template repo](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/issues/new?assignees=cansavvy&labels=&projects=&template=new-course-add-to-sync.md&title=), providing us with the necessary information to add the course for you.

In order for these syncs to happen we need credentials to do so. Our `jhudsl-robot` is what you need to give access to. 
- [ ] [Add the `jhudsl-robot` as a collaborator to your repository.](https://www.ottrproject.org/getting_started.html#5_Add_jhudsl-robot_as_a_collaborator).
