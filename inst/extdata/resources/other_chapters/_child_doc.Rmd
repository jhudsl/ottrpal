This is a bunch of cool text here that we want to reuse sometimes.

Maybe sometimes we have replacement here that we would like to be replaced. In fact, sometimes we might even have a some other replacement here here that needs replacing.

Sometimes these tags might end up in a url: [replacement here](https://www.ottrproject.org/).
