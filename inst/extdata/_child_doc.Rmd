# This is an H1 header

This is a bunch of cool text here that we want to reuse sometimes.

Maybe sometimes we have {A_TAG} that we would like to be replaced. In fact, sometimes we might even have a {SECOND_TAG} here that needs replacing.

Sometimes these tags might end up in a url: [{A_TAG}]({TEMPLATE_URL}).

## [{A_TAG}]({TEMPLATE_URL})

Sometimes we might even have a url in a header like above.
